# Scala - Options
Scala Option[T] is a container for zero or one element of a given type. An **Option[T]** can be either **Some[T]** or **None** object, which represents a missing value. For instance, the get method of Scala's Map produces **some(value)** if a value corresponding to a given key has been found, or **None** if the given key is not defined in the Map.

Option type is used frequently in Scala programs and you can compare this with the **null** value available in Java which indicate no value. For example, the get method of java.util.HashMap returns either a value stored in the HashMap, or null if no value was found.
